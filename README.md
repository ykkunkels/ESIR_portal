# ESM Item Repository

13-07-2023 YKK

Shiny app for the ESM Item Repository. With this app we aim to support the further development of Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) research by creating an open repository of existing ESM items.

Data is stored as a .csv file on "osf.io". It is then presented to users via this shiny app, making the ESM items searchable.
The app is deployed via "shinyapps.io". Visit our blog for additional information: "https://www.esmitemrepositoryinfo.com/".
