	abstract = {This project has built a repository of items  (www.esmitemrepository.com) used in experience sampling method ({ESM}), ecological momentary assessment ({EMA}) and ambulatory assessment ({AA}) studies. The idea for this repository arose out of discussions during the Open Science hackathon at the 2018 Belgian-Dutch {ESM} Network Meeting. 

In order to contribute items to the repository, you will need to download all five documents in the Contributors' Pack. When you have downloaded the {ESM} Item Repository submission template (spreadsheet) document, you can enter your items into it and then send it back to us via email (submissions [at] esmitemrepository.com). We will then collate all the submitted items into a repository and publish them here.

If you would like to browse the full repository and download items and their information, visit www.esmitemrepository.com.
